## **Colorful LEDs!**
This program uses while loops to stimulate the lighting up of variously colored LEDs for every multiple of 10 based on the input, runningTimes.

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Plan out the program on paper before attempting to write it--especially those that involve arithmetic.

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the output from the program with input: runningTimes = 100; index = 1.
