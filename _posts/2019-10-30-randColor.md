## **This is no trick, with one push of a button, treat yourself to a random color!**
This Arduino program uses user input in the form of a button, or a momentary switch, to yield an output of turning on a random colored LED by randomly selecting different RGB color values for each respective red, blue, and green LED, which combine to display a random color.

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Think carefully about what it means to have the same output as long as something is true. Hint: use state variables!

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Arduino code when the button is unpressed. The LED is off.

**Figure 2.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Arduino code when the button is pressed. The combination of random RGB LED values outputs a purple color.

**Figure 3.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Arduino code when the button is pressed. The combination of random RGB LED values outputs a blue color.
