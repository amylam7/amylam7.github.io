## **Allow this pretty program to determine the fate of your stomach!**
This program takes the user's integer input to select a specific menu type (regular or super secret) for the user. Then, using another integer input (numbers 1-3), the program chooses a delectable dish for the user. Enter any integer under "numberChoice" and enter any number 1-3 under "mealOption" to see what delicious meal is in store for you!

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Keep track of curly brackets! If you are making a nested if statement, do NOT close the bracket before the second if. It is very helpful to keep the "Nested Ifs" worksheet handy to make sure you keep the syntax well-organized and in order.
