## **Custom-built switches to light up our Sampler!**
This assignment involved creating homemade momentary switches using conductive thread and conductive fabric, which can be incorporated into our Sewing Sampler in order to light up LEDs sewn into the fabric when the circuit is manually closed by holding down the switches. First, we started by making a paper prototype of the circuit design in order to fully plan out the path of the circuitry and spatial arrangement of the breaks in the trace, which would be closed using conductive thread patches and conductive thread, and the individual Lilypad components, including the switched battery holder and 2 LEDs, in relation to the Sewing Sampler design to make an aesthetically pleasing prototype. Next, I transferred my paper prototype design into an actual circuit using alligator clips to visualize how the contact between the conductive thread patches and conductive fabric would serve to close the circuit and connect to function properly in lighting up the LEDs. Finally, I transferred this final design onto my Sewing Sampler by sewing the respective components in place and creating breaks in the trace to be closed with momentary switches made of conductive thread patches and conductive fabric to form makeshift buttons like those from Lilypad we have used in the past.


**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Pay very close attention to the respective + and - side of each of the components. Also, try to minimize the length of the circuits to decrease the chances of crossing conductive thread paths and other complications... simpler is better!

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the Homemade Switches Paper Prototype. This was my planning sheet for the design and circuitry of how I would incorporate conductive thread patches and conductive fabric to make momentary switches to connect Lilypad components in order to light up LEDs on my Sewing Sampler.

**Figure 2.** The above image presents the alligator prototyping stage of my Homemade Switches project. I created one break in the trace on the postive (+) path of the circuit, which I closed by carefully allowing contact between two separate pieces of conductive thread, which would represent the patches of conductive thread on my final prototype to light up the LEDs. I also created another break in the trace on the negative (-) path of the circuit, which I closed by connecting it to a patch of conductive fabric, which would represent the conductive fabric button that can be pressed down to create contact between the condcutive fabric and the two ends of the circuit trace in my final prototype to light up the LEDs.

**Figure 3.** The above image presents the front of the completed light-up Sewing Sampler using Homemade Switches. On the bottom of the Sampler, the patches of conductive thread should make contact to close the circuit by folding the heart patch of conductive thread to touch the two rectangle patches of conductive thread. In the middle of the Sampler, the central patch of conductive fabric can be pressed down to make contact with two patches of conductive fabric to close the circuit.
