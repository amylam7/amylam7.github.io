## **Ring in the holidays with this sick beat!**
This Arduino program uses a digital input, in the form of a switch, in order to determine whether or not to play "We Wish You a Merry Christmas." When the switch is ON, the song will play, but when the switch is OFF, the song will not play.

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Try to look for an existing song/music code that includes the use of a for loop. This will make it easier to manipulate the code to ensure that when the switch is turned on/off, the song will play/pause accordingly by checking for the condition of the switch after each note played as opposed to after the entire song of notes plays.

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the working behavior of the Arduino code when the switch is turned ON. You cannot visually see it, but "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" is playing. Note that when the switch is OFF, the Arudino board will look largely the same, but the snazzy song will not be playing.
