subtitle: Why I'm taking CS103

  Upon reading this course description, my immediate thought was: _No way this is real... This sounds like a Winter Study class, it seems too cool and niche to be a full semester course._ It was then that I decided that I wanted to take this course for the exact same reasons it struck me as almost _unreal_. To me, Winter Study represents a period of mental, emotional, and intellectual rejuvenation and healing from a grueling fall semester; the courses allow for an experimental and untraditional type of learning. 

  As a pre-med student constantly wrapped up in natural sciences courses and labwork, I was eager to experience a structured sense of a "brain-break" and an opportunity to interrupt my typical studies and to think and work more open-endedly and unconventionally, which is a privilige I typically only associate with Winter Study. To this end, I am excited to take this course because I hope to develop lifelong (basic) skills and knowledge of sewing and programming--both of which I am a complete newbie in--and furthermore, instill the notion in myself that exploratory learning and career-oriented goals do not have to be negotiated.
