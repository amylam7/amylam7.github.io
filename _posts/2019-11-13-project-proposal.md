## **Wear your heart on your shirt and proudly show people your fears of the dark!**
This project will involve creating a simple circuit of a switch and LEDs in a heart shape and connecting a light sensor and buzzer. The LEDs and buzzer will serve as analog outputs, while the switch will be a digital input and the light sensor will provide an analog input. The design is meant to light up the LEDs in the heart shape in a heart-beat like pattern when the switch is turned on. Simultaneously, the buzzer will play "lub-dub" sounds similar to that of a heartbeat. Using the light sensor inputs, when the environment gets darker, the flashing of the LEDs and the sounds of the buzzer will increase in frequency, simulating the increasing heart rate of an individual who is scared of the dark.
