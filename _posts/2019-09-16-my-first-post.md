## **Everything you need to know about me:**
+ **Name:** Amy Lam
+ **Year:** 2022
+ **Prospective Major(s):** Biology or Chemistry. Potential Biochemistry and Molecular Biology OR Public Health concentrator. Who knows...
+ **Sewing Experience:** None.
+ **Programming Experience:** None.
+ **What I hope to learn from this class:** When there is a hole in my shirt or part of the stitching in my pants has come loose, I usually run over to my parents to have them fix it. After this class, I hope to develop the skill, confidence, and independence necessary to survive on my own--starting with learning how to fix the sleeve of my own T-shirt. Further, I hope to learn some basic programming knowledge, hopefully as a starting point to delving deeper into computer science, which seems like an extremely valuable discipline to be well-versed in in the modern age, especially to boost job opportunities. 
+ **One boring fact about me:** I aspire to learn to flip food effortlessly in a pan like Gordan Ramsay.
