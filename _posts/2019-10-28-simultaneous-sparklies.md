## **Concurrent Critters!**
This Arduino program builds upon our first program, allowing us to further practice our Arduino syntax, language, and function skills similar to those used in the Separate Sparklies assignment. In this program, we are aiming to have the flashing patterns of the 3 different types of fireflies (flashbulb, synchronous, and big dipper) from the Separate Sparklies run simultaneously through 3 different LEDs, but using the same code. 

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Keep track of all of your variable names, try not to make more variables than necessary.

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Flashbulb Arduino code: flashes brightly for 0.5 seconds, every 4 seconds, starting at second 0.

![SynchronousSimultaneous](https://amylam7.github.io/img/synchronoussimultaneous.jpg)

**Figure 2.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Synchronous Arduino code: flashes brightly for 0.2 seconds, in a series of 3 flashes (separated by 0.1 secs each), every 10 seconds, starting at 0 seconds.

![BigDipperSimultaneous](https://amylam7.github.io/img/bigdippersimultaneous.jpg)

**Figure 3.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Big Dipper Arduino code: flashes every 3 seconds in a manner that gradually increases the brightness by 30 every 0.1 seconds.
