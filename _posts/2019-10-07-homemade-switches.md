## **Custom-built switches to light up our Sampler!**
This assignment involved creating homemade momentary switches using conductive thread and conductive fabric, which can be incorporated into our Sewing Sampler in order to light up LEDs sewn into the fabric when the circuit is manually closed by holding down the switches. First, we started by making a paper prototype of the circuit design in order to fully plan out the path of the circuitry and spatial arrangement of the breaks in the trace, which would be closed using conductive thread patches and conductive thread, and the individual Lilypad components, including the switched battery holder and 2 LEDs, in relation to the Sewing Sampler design to make an aesthetically pleasing prototype. Next, I transferred my paper prototype design into an actual circuit using alligator clips to visualize how the contact between the conductive thread patches and conductive fabric would serve to close the circuit and connect to function properly in lighting up the LEDs. Finally, I transferred this final design onto my Sewing Sampler by sewing the respective components in place and creating breaks in the trace to be closed with momentary switches made of conductive thread patches and conductive fabric to form makeshift buttons like those we have used in the past.


**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Pay very close attention to the respective + and - side of each of the components. Also, try to minimize the length of the circuits to decrease the chances of crossing conductive thread paths and other complications... simpler is better!

**Figure 4.** The above image presents the alligator prototyping stage of the plushy. However, I forgot to take a photo of the actual alligator prototyping stage so I have recreated the alligator prototype I made using paper cut-outs of the pieces, connected with alligator clips as it originally was.
