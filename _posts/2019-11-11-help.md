## **H E L P...**
This Arduino program uses digital input in order to determine whether the circuit is closed (alligator clips are connected) or open (alligator clips are unconnected) to either emit the morse code for "SOS" or "AMY" for each case, respectively. Also, think carefully about how you want to connect the two different off-board input and output, this is the first time I have used two offboard connections and it got a litle confusing for me (careful not to short circuit!).

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** In order to call a function within an if statement, make sure there is a return within the function that can be evaluated as true or false (boolean).

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the working behavior from the Arduino code when the alligator clips are unconnected. Though it is not visually detectable, the morse code "AMY" is being emitted.
