## **Fluttering Fireflies!**
This program is our first step into Arduino programming, which uses a unique language similar to the C programming language we have been using. Using some of the built-in Arduino functions and some programming concepts we learned in C, such as loops, we designed 3 separate codes to mimic the flashing patterns of 3 different types of fireflies: flashbulb, synchronous, and big dipper.

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Really take some time to try to understand the different components and functions in Arduino programming before attacking this. Also, don't be afraid to play around with some of the example codes and change as much as you can while still getting it to work.

**Figure 1.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Arduino code: flashes brightly for 0.5 seconds, every 4 seconds, starting at second 0.

**Figure 2.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Arduino code: flashes brightly for 0.2 seconds, in a series of 3 flashes (separated by 0.1 secs each), every 10 seconds, starting at 0 seconds.

**Figure 3.** The above image presents the working LED behavior from the Arduino code: flashes every 3 seconds in a manner that gradually increases the brightness by 30 every 0.1 seconds.
