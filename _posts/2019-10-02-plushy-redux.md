## **Check out how our Circuit Plushy can light up your world!**
This program uses the state of the slide switch and button to predict the circuit behavior of our circuit plushy to present how the LEDs are expected to behave.

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Nested ifs are helpful in making code less repetitive and more brief. Look for repetition and see if you can incorporate a nested if to reduce redundancy in the code. Also, watch those curly brackets, don't let them invade within nested ifs!
