## **Let this Plushy light up your world!**
This assignment entailed creating a light-up plushy using LEDs and Lilypad circuit pieces in order to form a functioning simply circuit sewn into fabric. First, we started by making a paper prototype of the circuit design in order to plan out how the individual Lilypad components, including a battery holder, 3 LEDs, a switch, and a button, would connect in order to form a circuit. Subsequently, I transferred this paper prototype into an actual circuit using alligator clips to connect the Lilypad components to ensure that the circuit would actually work in the layout my design presented. Finally, I transferred this final functioning design onto my plushy design by sewing the components into the appropriate spots and connecting them with conductive thread. After stitching together the rest of the plushy, I was thrilled to come up with an awesome light-up plushtoy!

**Tip/Trick for my Past Self:** Make sure to secure the pieces into the fabric by making a couple loops at each hole/junction point with the conductive thread.

**Figure 4.** The above image presents the alligator prototyping stage of the plushy. However, I forgot to take a photo of the actual alligator prototyping stage so I have recreated the alligator prototype I made using paper cut-outs of the pieces, connected with alligator clips as it originally was.
