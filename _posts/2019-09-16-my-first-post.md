## **Everything you need to know:**
+ **Name:** [Amy Lam](https://wso.williams.edu/facebook/users/10818)
+ **Year:** 2022
+ **Prospective Major(s):** Biology or Chemistry (Pre-med)
+ **Sewing Experience:** None, but I have always been interested in learning!
+ **Programming Experience:** None, but I have _also_ always been interested in learning!
+ **What I hope to learn from this class:** When there is a hole in my shirt or the stitching of my jean pocket has come loose, I usually run over to my parents to have them fix it. After this class, I hope to develop the sewing skills, confidence, and independence necessary to survive on my own--starting with learning how to fix the sleeve of my own T-shirt. Furthermore, I aspire to learn some basic programming knowledge, hopefully as a starting point to delving deeper into computer science, which seems like an extremely valuable discipline to be well-versed in in the modern age, especially to boost job opportunities. 
+ **One boring fact about me:** I yearn to master an effortless food-in-pan flip like Gordan Ramsay.
