## **Scaredy Cat Sensor Prototype!**
This project will involve creating a simple circuit of a switch and LEDs in a heart shape and connecting a light sensor and buzzer. The LEDs and buzzer will serve as analog outputs, while the switch will be a digital input and the light sensor will provide an analog input. The design is meant to light up the LEDs in the heart shape in a heart-beat like pattern when the switch is turned on. Simultaneously, the buzzer will play "lub-dub" sounds similar to that of a heartbeat. Using the light sensor inputs, when the environment gets darker, the flashing of the LEDs and the sounds of the buzzer will increase in frequency, simulating the increasing heart rate of an individual who is scared of the dark. In addition, there will be a homemade button in the shape of an anatomical heart in the center of the heart, which can be pressed to stimulate the song "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees, which is a song commonly used to keep the beat of CPR compressions, acting as an emergency button if the "Scaredy Cat" goes into cardiac arrest from such intense fear of the dark, a bystander can press their shirt to play the song to keep the rhythm of CPR until further help arrives.

**Figure 1.** The image above presents the proposed circuit design of my final project. I will be sure to use fabric glue and/or paint to insulate the traces as my current circuit design has a number of overlapping traces that could be very problematic.
